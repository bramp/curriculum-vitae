        abstract = {The advances in wireless networking and the consequent
emergence of new applications that wireless networks increasingly
support inevitably leads to low capability mobile
nodes connecting to peer-to-peer networks. However, the
characteristics of mobile nodes and limitations of access
point coverage often cause mobile nodes to lose connectivity,
which can cause many mobile nodes to simultaneously
rejoin the network. Continuous departures and joins due
to the mobility of nodes leads to mobility churn, which can
often degrade the performance of the underlying peer-topeer
network significantly. In this paper, we use simulations
to demonstrate that the Stealth Distributed Hash Table
(Stealth DHT) algorithm is ideally suited for networks
with mobile nodes. By avoiding storing state in unreliable
nodes, a Stealth DHT prevents mobile nodes from being
used by other nodes to provide services. Consequently,
Stealth DHTs eliminate the mobility churn effect and significantly
reduce the amount of overhead as compared to a
generic DHT. This paper demonstrates this using simulation
results that compare the performance of Stealth DHTs
to a generic DHT, Pastry.}

        abstract = {Most existing DHT algorithms assume that all nodes
have equal capabilities. This assumption has previously
been shown to be untrue in real deployments, where the
heterogeneity of nodes can actually have a detrimental effect upon performance. In this paper, we acknowledge that
nodes on the same overlay may also differ in terms of their
trustworthiness. However, implementing and enforcing security policies in a network where all nodes are treated
equally is a non-trivial task. We therefore extend our previous work on Stealth DHTs to consider the differentiation of nodes based on their trustworthiness rather than their capabilities alone.}

        abstract = {Most Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) simply consider interconnecting
homogeneous nodes on the same overlay. However,
realistically nodes on a network are heterogeneous
in terms of their capabilities. Because of this, traditional
DHTs have been shown to exhibit poor performance in a
real-world environment. Additionally, we believe that it is
this approach that contributes to a limited exploitation of
peer-to-peer technologies. Previous work on super-peers in
DHTs was proposed to address these performance issues,
however the strategy used is often based on locally clustering peers around individual super-peers. This method of superpeering, however, compromises fundamental features such as load-balancing, resilience and routing efficiency, which traditional DHTs originally promised to offer. We propose a Stealth DHT which addresses the deficiencies
of previous super-peer approaches by using the DHT algorithm itself to select the most appropriate super-peer for each message sent by peers. Through simulations and measurements, we show the fitness for purpose of our proposal.}
