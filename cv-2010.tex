& During the three years at Lancaster I have been involved in numerous projects, some of which I worked on my own, and others where I worked in small teams. My tasks would typically be research oritated (such as running and analysing experiments, and publishing my results), but in additional to this I have helped with teaching undergraduate and masters students. This included running seminars, lab supervising, marking, and lecturing.\\

%  \textbf{Stealth Distributed Hash Table}\\
% % Java simulator
% % C++ implementation that ran over a unrelaible planet sized testbed
% % Many publications
%  The beginning of my Ph.D. focused on distrubuted hash tables (DHTs), specifically how to make them more reliable and suitable for high performance applications. This work led to me create a Java based peer-to-peer simulator with implementations of a couple of DHTs, followed by a C++ implementation suitable for running real experiments over PlanetLab. During this time I learnt many techiniques for making fast and high performing Java applications, as well as learning the perils of trying to use a 650 node network scattered across the globe as a experimental testbed. This work led to numerous conference papers and a couple of journal publications, as well as source code being made available.

%  Whilst working on the Autonomic Content Distribution Network (aCDN) project I wanted to understand the workloads generated by users seeking heavily though a video, and how I could create algorithms and techniques to improve this. To begin this work I created a Video-on-Demand platform which could be viewed via a website. Then I captured and transcoded the 2006 FIFA world cup (soccer) and made these matches available to users on the Lancaster Campus. This generated enough data for me to form statistical models, which led on to algorithms that a server can use to aid in prefetching and caching to improve the user's experience. This generated a few conference papers and was the basis for my Ph.D. thesis.

% % Hacking the Linux kernel
%  This project aimed to improve general networking on multi-process or multi-core servers whilst using 10Gbit or more networks. To achieve this we highly instrimented the Linux kernel, which allowed us to figure out exactly what the problems are with high speed networking, and specifically what impact multi-core archecitures had. Later we developed a few techniques specifically designed for multi-core environments which would improve performance for multiple applications. This work produced a couple of conference papers and later became a chapter in a coleages Ph.D. thesis.

%  Over the last two years in my free time I've been involved in a technology start-up whose aim is to create a high performance networking platform running on low cost commodity hardware. To this end I have been in chief architect and developer creating a flexible system able to sustain high packet throughputs. This work is based on a custom networking engine written as a FreeBSD kernel module. Over the two years I have had extensive experience developing for the FreeBSD 7 and 8 kernels, and have managed to achieve near linear scaling of packet forwarding with the number of cores, up to a tested rate of 40Mpps. This networking platform has not yet been publicly announced, and its our hope to get funding in the near future.

%  In my free time I have contributed to numerous Open Source projects, and have even started a few myself. To name just a few I have had patches accepted by, Linux, FreeBSD, PHP, Google Chrome, Google Android, Intel's Networking Drivers, HeidiSQL, and many more. In addition to this I have open sourced and made available numerous projects ranging from academic network simulation and benchmarking to an application to mount Nintendo DS roms, to scripts for converting ordnance survey coordinates to GPS coordinates.

\section{Projects}
 \textbf{Stealth Distributed Hash Table}\\
 Designed, implemented and evaluated a new form of distrubuted hash table (DHT), which is more reliable and suitable for high performance applications.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Created a Java based peer-to-peer network simulator, which could accurately model underlying network properties.
  \item Created a C++ implementation with LUA bindings, to allow the Stealth DHT to be used in a real environment.
  \item Used PlanetLab (a 650 node testbed, with hosts at 300+ sites across the Internet) to experiment with the DHT and to obtain more realistic results.
  \item The work produced numerous conference papers~\cite{rai2007pmp, brampton2006sdh, macquire2006asd, macquire2006pas,  brampton2005sdh}, a journal article~\cite{macquire2008asd}, as well as all the source code being made available.
 \end{itemize}

 \textbf{Interactive Video-on-Demand}\\
% PHP website + tools to aid in capturing, preparing and streaming
 Whilst working on the Autonomic Content Distribution Network (aCDN) project I wanted to understand the workloads generated by users seeking heavily though a video, and how I could create algorithms and techniques to improve this. To begin this work I created a Video-on-Demand platform which could be viewed via a website.

This generated enough data for me to form statistical models, which led on to algorithms that a server can use to aid in prefetching and caching to improve the user's experience. This generated a few conference papers and was the basis for my Ph.D. thesis.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Created and maintained a Video-on-Demand (VoD) system using PHP and Flash video, including the development of tools and scripts to capture video, encode, and upload to the system.
 \item Created statistical models based on recorded user behaviour.
 \item Created and developed algorithms to improve prefetching and caching for interactive VoD.
 \item This work was published at conferences~\cite{brampton2007cui,macquire2008acf}, in a journal~\cite{brampton2008cew}, and finally became the foundation of my Ph.D. thesis. In addition all source code and recorded traces were released~\footnote{\href{http://bramp.net/blog/flvtool-a-command-line-flash-video-file-flv-editor}{http://bramp.net/blog/flvtool-a-command-line-flash-video-file-flv-editor} and \href{http://www.rcdn.org/}{http://www.rcdn.org/}}.
\end{itemize}

 \textbf{10Gbit+ Networking on Multi-core platforms}\\
% Hacking the Linux kernel
 At the beginning of my postdoc, I helped on a project which aimed to identify and remove any bottlenecks with high speed networking on multi-processor or multi-core machines. The tasks I carried out are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Instrumented the Linux network stack, and used tools such as OProfile.
 \item Rewrote segments of the Linux kernel to improve TCP performance when used specifically on multi-core architectures.
 \item Produced one paper~\cite{faulkner2009epn}, a network benchmarking tool~\footnote{\href{http://bramp.net/blog/threadnetperf-v1-0}{http://bramp.net/blog/threadnetperf-v1-0}}, and a Ph.D. thesis for another student.
