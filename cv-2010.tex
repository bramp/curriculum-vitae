 \emph{Current} & Research Associate at \textsc{Lancaster University} \\
 \textsc{Sept 2007} & \emph{Networking Researcher}\\
& During the three years at Lancaster I have been involved in numerous projects, some of which involved working in small teams and others working alone. My tasks were typically research orientated (such as running and analysing experiments, and publishing my results), but in addition to this I have helped with teaching undergraduate and master's students. This included running seminars, supervising labs, marking coursework, and lecturing.\\

\section{Projects}
 \textbf{Stealth Distributed Hash Table}\\
 Designed, implemented and evaluated a new type of distributed hash table (DHT), a form of peer-to-peer network, which was designed to be more reliable than existing DHTs, and suitable for high performance applications.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Created a Java based peer-to-peer network simulator, which could accurately model underlying network properties.
  \item Created a C++ implementation with LUA bindings, to allow the Stealth DHT to be used in a real environment.
  \item Used PlanetLab (a 650 node testbed, with hosts at 300+ sites across the Internet) to experiment with the DHT and to obtain more `realistic' Internet results.
  \item The work produced numerous conference papers~\cite{rai2007pmp, brampton2006sdh, macquire2006asd, macquire2006pas,  brampton2005sdh}, a journal article~\cite{macquire2008asd}, as well as all the source code being made available.
 \end{itemize}
\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Interactive Video-on-Demand}\\
To aid my research into interactive video-on-demand I required realistic workloads of users heavily seeking through a video. To this end I captured and served the 2006 FIFA World Cup (soccer), and recorded how users consumed the content.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Created and maintained a Video-on-Demand (VoD) system using PHP and Flash video, including the development of tools and scripts to capture video, encode, and upload to the system.
 \item Created statistical models based on recorded user behaviour.
 \item Created and developed algorithms to improve prefetching and caching for interactive VoD.
 \item This work was published at conferences~\cite{brampton2007cui,macquire2008acf}, in a journal~\cite{brampton2008cew}, and finally became the foundation of my Ph.D. thesis. In addition, all source code and recorded traces were released\footnote{\href{http://bramp.net/blog/flvtool-a-command-line-flash-video-file-flv-editor}{http://bramp.net/blog/flvtool-a-command-line-flash-video-file-flv-editor} and \href{http://www.rcdn.org/}{http://www.rcdn.org/}}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{10Gbit+ Networking on Multi-core platforms}\\
% Hacking the Linux kernel
 At the beginning of my postdoctoral research, I helped on a project which aimed to identify and remove bottlenecks associated with high speed networking on multi-processor or multi-core machines.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Instrumented the Linux network stack, and used tools such as OProfile.
 \item Rewrote segments of the Linux kernel to improve TCP performance when used specifically on multi-core architectures.
 \item This project produced one paper~\cite{faulkner2009epn}, a network benchmarking tool\footnote{\href{http://bramp.net/blog/threadnetperf-v1-0}{http://bramp.net/blog/threadnetperf-v1-0}}, and a Ph.D. thesis for another student.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{High Performance Routing on Commodity Hardware}\\
% Hacking the FreeBSD kernel
 Over the last two years, in my free time, I've been involved in a technology start-up whose aim is to create a high performance networking platform running on low-cost commodity hardware. I have been the chief architect and developer creating a flexible system able to sustain high packet throughputs. This work is based on a custom network engine written as a FreeBSD kernel module. Over the two years I have had extensive experience developing for the FreeBSD 7 and 8 kernels, and have managed to achieve almost linear scaling of packet forwarding with the number of cores, up to a tested rate of 40Mpps (packets per second) with throughputs easily exceeding 20Gbps. This networking platform has not yet been publicly announced, and it is our hope to get funding in the near future.
\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Open Source}\\
 In my free time I have contributed to numerous Open Source projects, and have even started a few myself. To name just a few I have had patches accepted by Linux, FreeBSD, PHP, Google Chrome, Google Android, Intel's Networking Drivers, HeidiSQL, and many more. In addition to this I have open sourced and made available numerous projects ranging from academic network simulation and benchmarking to an application to mount Nintendo DS roms\footnote{\href{http://bramp.net/blog/ndsfs-a-fuse-application-to-mount-nintendo-ds-roms}{http://bramp.net/blog/ndsfs-a-fuse-application-to-mount-nintendo-ds-roms}}, to scripts for converting ordnance survey coordinates to GPS coordinates\footnote{\href{http://bramp.net/blog/os-easting-northing-to-lat-long}{http://bramp.net/blog/os-easting-northing-to-lat-long}}.
