\begin{tabular}{r|p{13.5cm}}

 \textsc{Mar 2012-} & \textbf{Manager, Mobile Marketing Development} at \textsc{SoundBite Communications} \\
 \emph{Current}     & In this role I lead a growing team of developers, system administrators and QA testers. I continue to define
			the technology and direction for the mobile marketing arm of SoundBite. This includes maintaining our high-volume
			SMS messaging platforms, developing our mobile web systems, and overseeing the development of smartphone apps.\\
&\\
 \textsc{Jun 2011-} & \textbf{Head of Technology} at \textsc{2ergo Americas} \\
 \textsc{Mar 2012}  & When I first joined 2ergo Americas, they had no technical leadership, and in my role of Systems Administrator
			I quickly became the ``go-to guy'' for solving problems. After many months of defining our process, and
			deciding what technologies we should use, I eased into the role of Head of Technology. My duties included ensuring 
			2ergo Americans had a unified view, managing our developers and sysadmin staff, and ensuring things kept working.
			In the following 9 months, I planned and led the migration to a virtualised environment, designed a global messaging
			infrastructure, and headed the technical integration with SoundBite when they acquired 2ergo Americas. \\

 \textsc{Oct 2010-} & \textbf{Systems Administrator} at \textsc{2ergo Americas} \\
 \textsc{Jun 2011}  %& \emph{DevOps Extraordinaire}
                    & As the only sysadmin I was responsible for maintaining over 50 servers and keeping our systems running well. 
			I entered the role of sysadmin with little hand-over, and spent the first few months learning and documenting the numerous systems.
			Eventually I got a handle and started to stream line and standardise the various platforms. Included in this role was miscellaneous devolpment work,
			when and as it was needed. \\

 \textsc{Oct 2007-} & \textbf{Research Associate} at \textsc{Lancaster University} \\
 \textsc{Oct 2010}  & \emph{Networking Researcher}\\
                    & During the three years at Lancaster I have been involved in numerous projects, some of which involved working in small teams and others working alone. My tasks were typically research orientated (such as running and analysing experiments, and publishing my results), but in addition to this I have helped with teaching undergraduate and master's students. This included running seminars, supervising labs, marking coursework, and lecturing.\\

\section{Research Projects}
 \textbf{Stealth Distributed Hash Table}\\
 Designed, implemented and evaluated a new type of distributed hash table (DHT), a form of peer-to-peer network, which was designed to be more reliable than existing DHTs, and suitable for high performance applications.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Created a Java based peer-to-peer network simulator, which could accurately model underlying network properties.
  \item Created a C++ implementation with LUA bindings, to allow the Stealth DHT to be used in a real environment.
  \item Used PlanetLab (a 650 node testbed, with hosts at 300+ sites across the Internet) to experiment with the DHT and to obtain more `realistic' Internet results.
  \item The work produced numerous conference papers~\cite{rai2007pmp, brampton2006sdh, macquire2006asd, macquire2006pas,  brampton2005sdh}, a journal article~\cite{macquire2008asd}, as well as all the source code being made available.
 \end{itemize}
\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Interactive Video-on-Demand}\\
To aid my research into interactive video-on-demand I required realistic workloads of users heavily seeking through a video. To this end I captured and served the 2006 FIFA World Cup (soccer), and recorded how users consumed the content.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Created and maintained a Video-on-Demand (VoD) system using PHP and Flash video, including the development of tools and scripts to capture video, encode, and upload to the system.
 \item Created statistical models based on recorded user behaviour.
 \item Created and developed algorithms to improve prefetching and caching for interactive VoD.
 \item This work was published at conferences~\cite{brampton2007cui,macquire2008acf}, in a journal~\cite{brampton2008cew}, and finally became the foundation of my Ph.D. thesis. In addition, all source code and recorded traces were released\footnote{\href{http://bramp.net/blog/flvtool-a-command-line-flash-video-file-flv-editor}{http://bramp.net/blog/flvtool-a-command-line-flash-video-file-flv-editor} and \href{http://www.rcdn.org/}{http://www.rcdn.org/}}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{10Gbit+ Networking on Multi-core platforms}\\
% Hacking the Linux kernel
 At the beginning of my postdoctoral research, I helped on a project which aimed to identify and remove bottlenecks associated with high speed networking on multi-processor or multi-core machines.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Instrumented the Linux network stack, and used tools such as OProfile.
 \item Rewrote segments of the Linux kernel to improve TCP performance when used specifically on multi-core architectures.
 \item This project produced one paper~\cite{faulkner2009epn}, a network benchmarking tool\footnote{\href{http://bramp.net/blog/threadnetperf-v1-0}{http://bramp.net/blog/threadnetperf-v1-0}}, and a Ph.D. thesis for another student.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{High Performance Routing on Commodity Hardware}\\
% Hacking the FreeBSD kernel
 Over the last two years, in my free time, I've been involved in a technology start-up whose aim is to create a high performance networking platform running on low-cost commodity hardware. I have been the chief architect and developer creating a flexible system able to sustain high packet throughputs. This work is based on a custom network engine written as a FreeBSD kernel module. Over the two years I have had extensive experience developing for the FreeBSD 7 and 8 kernels, and have managed to achieve almost linear scaling of packet forwarding with the number of cores, up to a tested rate of 40Mpps (packets per second) with throughputs easily exceeding 20Gbps. This networking platform has not yet been publicly announced, and it is our hope to get funding in the near future.
